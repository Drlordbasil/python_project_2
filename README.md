# python_project_2

This is a Python project named `python_project_2` that aims to develop an AI-powered personal finance assistant. The project will provide functionalities for expense tracking, budgeting and goal setting, intelligent recommendations, bill reminders and payment automation, and financial education. It also includes monetization strategies to generate revenue.

## Features

1. Expense tracking:
   - `input_expense(amount, date, category)`: Allows users to input their expenses, including the amount, date, and category. This function stores the expenses in a data structure for further processing.
   - `categorize_expenses(expenses)`: Implements a categorization algorithm to automatically assign categories to expenses based on keywords or machine learning techniques.
   - `analyze_expenses(expenses)`: Develops a module that calculates spending patterns, generates visualizations, and provides insights on spending habits using libraries like pandas and matplotlib.
   - `check_budget_limits(expenses, budget_limits)`: Creates a function that checks the total expenses in specific categories and alerts the user when they are close to exceeding their budget limits.

2. Budgeting and goal setting:
   - `set_budget(category, budget)`: Designs a user interface that allows users to set budgets for different expense categories.
   - `track_budget_progress(expenses, budget_limits)`: Compares the expenses with the budget limits and provides real-time feedback on the progress.
   - `set_financial_goal(goal, target_amount)`: Develops a module that allows users to set financial goals and track the progress towards achieving them.
   - `track_goal_progress(goals, expenses)`: Tracks the progress towards achieving the goals set by the user.
   - `suggest_actionable_steps(goals, expenses, income, savings)`: Creates a recommendation engine that analyzes the user's financial data and suggests actionable steps to achieve goals.

3. Intelligent recommendations:
   - `generate_personalized_recommendations(goals, expenses, external_factors)`: Builds a recommendation system that analyzes the user's financial data, goals, and external factors to provide personalized recommendations.
   - `suggest_investment_opportunities(risk_tolerance, return_expectations, market_data)`: Implements algorithms to suggest investment opportunities based on factors like risk tolerance, return expectations, and historical market data.
   - `suggest_credit_card_rewards_programs(expenses, preferences)`: Develops a module that suggests credit card rewards programs based on the user's spending patterns and preferences.
   - `identify_expense_reduction_areas(expenses)`: Creates algorithms to identify potential areas for expense reduction and provide suggestions on cost-saving measures.

4. Bill reminders and payment automation:
   - `set_bill_reminders(bills)`: Integrates with a calendar system to set reminders for upcoming bills and due dates.
   - `send_bill_reminders(bills)`: Implements a notification system to send reminders to users before bill due dates.
   - `automate_bill_payments(bills, banking_api)`: Integrates with banking systems using APIs to automate bill payments securely.
   - `track_bill_payments(bills, payment_history)`: Tracks and records bill payments for future reference.

5. Financial education:
   - `access_educational_resources(topic)`: Curates educational resources on personal finance topics and provides access to these resources through the personal finance assistant.
   - `deliver_personalized_tips(goals, expenses, income)`: Develops a module that delivers personalized financial tips and recommendations based on the user's financial situation and goals.
   - `answer_user_questions(question)`: Implements a feature that allows users to ask questions and receive informative answers using natural language processing techniques.
   - `track_learning_progress()`: Provides a user-friendly interface to access educational content and track progress in improving financial literacy.
